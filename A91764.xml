            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sir, you will ea≈øily imagine that affairs are ≈øteered here by the Court Compa≈ø≈øe; and if the de≈øign be to make peace with the Rebels, that ≈øo this Army may be applicable el≈øewhere: Our pre≈øence any longer at the Board, will not further that de≈øign; however, The time we have there ≈øpent, and the experience gained by that, will perhaps be ≈øerviceable to you at our return, which we now ha≈øten (as becomes us) all we can, And re≈øolve to depart hence this week, being retarded only to ≈øee the Lord <hi>Li≈øle</hi> in a good Po≈øture for his hopefull Expedition, be being re≈øolved to march on Tue≈øday next. We conceive it very nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend a Ship of ≈øtrength and tru≈øt to ride in <hi>Bullock</hi>-Road before <hi>Dublyn,</hi> and another of le≈ø≈øe burthen, to ride before <hi>Drogheda.</hi>

            <p>We had almo≈øt forgot to tell you, That the labour is on both ≈øides the Sea, to make the Rebels appear ≈øtrong and con≈øiderable, and to put difficulties and impediments upon our Military proceedings, the better to bring on a mo≈øt horrid pernitious peace, which all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here do abhorre, and are re≈øolved to abandon the Kingdom, rather then to be expo≈øed to an utter extirpation upon the next opportunity, which tho≈øe bloudy, but incon≈øiderable vi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>BY command from the Lord Marque≈ø≈øe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> certain Forces of both Hor≈øe and Foot were ≈øent unto <hi>Trym,</hi> for the relief of <hi>Athlone,</hi> with a direction unto Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill</hi> to have the chief Command thereof; which Forces arrived at <hi>Trym</hi> on Thur≈øday 26 <hi>January</hi>; and on Friday morning then following, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> marched thence toward <hi>Athlone</hi> with about 900 Foot, and al≈øo about 200 Hor≈øe; and that night all lodged at <hi>Athboy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saturday the 28, being come nigh unto <hi>Ballinacur,</hi> being a very ≈øtrong pa≈ø≈øe, we found the Enemy po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing it with 300 men, having cut off there a Bridge, whereat Sir <hi>Richard</hi> commanded certain Dragooners to force that Pa≈ø≈øe, and al≈øo ≈øent a Party of Hor≈øe to ≈øecond them; which the enemy oppo≈øed, untill ≈øome of the Hor≈øe found a place there by, where they leapt over a deep ditch of water; which put them all to ≈ølight over a Bogge there by: In which e≈øcape divers of the Rebells were ≈ølain, and as it is ≈øaid, al≈øo one of their Commanders. That night we lodged at and about <hi>Killeenan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sunday the 29, marching forwards, 4 of our Hor≈øe Scouts e≈øpyed 4 Hor≈øe Scouts of the Rebells, on the top of a hill before them; who ≈øeeing our Scouts, ha≈øtning towards them, with≈øtood them, being Country Gentlemen of good quality; and being but 4 to 4, they encountred each other a while fairly, with onely their ≈øwords, untill one of the Rebells had both given and received a wound, and was ≈øeized on by one of our Scouts; whereat the re≈øt, being very well mounted, e≈øcaped away, leaving their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be ≈ølain in the place: And being come nigh <hi>Tobbercormick</hi> (where we lay that night) ≈øome of our Hor≈øe took a Gentlewoman of ≈øome quality pri≈øoner, who ≈øtood on a hill there by, guarded with ≈øome Muskettiers.</p>
            <p>Munday the 30, being come within 5 miles of <hi>Athlone,</hi> we took one M. <hi>Richard Dillon</hi> pri≈øoner, who informed Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> That Generall <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> was ≈øending all
<pb facs="tcp:112678:2"/>
the Forces he could make, to hinder our coming to <hi>Athlone,</hi> and therefore wi≈øhed us to make all the ha≈øte thither we could: Pre≈øently thereon, a Hor≈øe-man of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn hope came back, and informed Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> That ≈øeven Colours of the enemies Forces were then marching towards us. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> then pre≈øently commanded forth more of his Hor≈øe to ha≈øten to ≈øecond the fore-Troop, which in that Intrim charged the enemy, who retreated to a Bog, where mo≈øt of them might have been out off, had not the care of the Safe-Conduct of the provi≈øions appointed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Athlone</hi> forbidden it. That night we all came ≈øafe at <hi>Athlone,</hi> where we all ≈øtayed the next day following.</p>
            <p>Wedne≈øday the 31, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ≈øent all our Hor≈øe and Foot to quarter at <hi>Kilkenny</hi>-We≈øt, four miles thence, untill ≈øuch time as 300 of the Lord <hi>Rannelaugh's</hi> Regiment, and three hundred of Sir <hi>Michael Earnlyes</hi> Regiment could be drawn thither from their out-Garri≈øons, to march back with us: And when our Hor≈øe approached nigh unto <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> they di≈øcovered that it was ≈øtrongly manned by Sir <hi>James Dillons</hi> Forces, Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> his Troop, and Colonell <hi>Farrell's</hi> Regiment, of the County of <hi>Longford</hi>; whereat Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> with ≈øome of our Hor≈øe, fell into their Quarters, and killed a Captain, and ≈øome other Officers, and al≈øo about 50 of their Souldiers, and took many of their Arms, and po≈ø≈øe≈øt their Quarters untill Saturday.</p>
            <p>Saturday the 4 of <hi>Febr:</hi> we all quartered at and about a place called, The Moat, at which time the 600 of the Lord <hi>Rannelaugh's,</hi> and Sir <hi>Michael Earnlyes</hi> Regiments were lodged with ours, where Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> found in his Quarters an Engli≈øh mans wife, who told him, that the generall report of the Countrey was, That the Iri≈øh had gathered all the Forces they could get together, and were confident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe us in on every ≈øide, and to cut us all off, re≈øolving and vowing not to leave a man of us alive: ≈øaying al≈øo, That if we ≈øhould get the Victory, the heart of their Wars would be broken, for that there was an ancient Prophe≈øie much talked of among the Iri≈øh, That that ≈øide which ≈øhould win the Battell at <hi>Rathconnell,</hi> ≈øhould be Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Kingdom; it being a Tradition ≈øuper≈øtitiou≈øly held among≈øt the Native Iri≈øh.</p>
            <p>On Munday the 5 and 6, we marched towards <hi>Trym,</hi> meeting with no oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but very foul weather and wayes, which greatly di≈øheartned the Souldiers, and killed divers of them; in which time we took ≈øeverall of the Countrey people, who all confirmed the former reports of the enemies Forces, and intentions: Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill</hi> notwith≈øtanding ≈øaid, He was re≈øolved not to march a foot out of his way, were the enemy never ≈øo ≈øtrong.</p>
            <p>Tue≈øday the 7, proceeding in our March, we under≈øtood of divers Troops of Hor≈øe and Foot that daily had followed our Rear, which then was guarded by a Troop of Hor≈øe commanded by Lievtenant <hi>Hatcher,</hi> who charged certain Forces of the enemy which were advanced ≈øomewhat nigh him, and then cut off about twenty of them. Afterwards, about 11 of the clock the ≈øame day, being come nigh <hi>Mollingar,</hi> we took a pri≈øoner, who told us that the Iri≈øh Forces po≈ø≈øe≈øt our Pa≈ø≈øe of <hi>Rathconnell,</hi> a mile before us, being very ≈øtrong in number of men, and the prime Officers and Gentry of of the Countrey.

Likewi≈øe for the forlorn hope of the Rear Captain <hi>Pate</hi> commanded 40 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners, which were al≈øo a≈ø≈øi≈øted with 20 Fire-locks: which done ≈øeeing not onely a ≈øtrong enemy of above 2000 Foot, and ≈øix Hor≈øe Troops before us, and others at lea≈øt 600 on our right hand, and 600 more of <hi>Longford</hi> men at a di≈øtance on our left hand, upon the Boggs, not farre off, from which were ha≈øtning up to ≈øecond their, as it is ≈øaid, 800 of the Realies; and then, unknown to us, there was waiting upon our Rear 500 more, which then newly po≈ø≈øe≈øt <hi>Mollingar,</hi> about half a mile behinde us, to hinder our Retreat.
